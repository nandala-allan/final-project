# Kanzu Police Force App

The Kanzu code police web app is aimed at helping the police force capture and store criminal data in a single database other than the traditional books(black books)

## How it works
This Kanzu Police Application is a data capture tool that is meant to input, return and process criminal data. The application can also be modifided in the code structure to suit other organisations in usage.

1. When you run our application, you will find a "login page" with some information on what the app/organisation is all about and their core values. You will also be prompted to sign in for user's authentication.

2. Upon signing in, you will be re-directed to the "Home Page" which has the "Creat New Case Form" & "Search Form"

3. Create New Case Form:
This will lead you to the form structure page which has fields ready to input data as the victim's statement is being captured by the officer assigned to the case.

Upon clicking the submission button, the data is then stored in the backend strapi servers to be used later.

4. Search Form:
The search form button is a one that will lead you to a search page where an inut field is used to retrieve data of any previous cases captured. This can be used by law enforcement agencies to process data for rulings and statistics also for printing.

The function returns data as expected.

## Technologies Used
React(Frontend)
Vite
Fetch API(For making requests)
CSS for styling.

## Installation
To run the application, you will have to intall the NPM directories and the different dependencies, upon which you will have to "npm run dev" to render the application in the chrome browser.
